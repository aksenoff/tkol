Don't get any big ideas;
They're not gonna happen.

You paint yourself white,
And fill all the holes;
There'll be something missing.
Now that you've found it,
It's gone.
Now that you feel it,
You don't.
You've gone off the rails.

So don't get any big ideas;
They're not gonna happen.
You'll go to hell for what your
Dirty mind is thinking.
